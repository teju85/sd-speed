              *** SD card speed test **


0. Introduction:
 This is a very handy script to measure the bandwidth of the sd-card on your
android phones. You just need to plug your phone with USB cable to a PC and
run the 'appropriate' script.


1. How to run?
 Decide what script you will need to run using the table below:
  a. On Linux:   use the script 'sdCardSpeedTest.sh'.
  b. On Windows: use the script 'sdCardSpeedTest.bat'.
  c. On Mac:     TODO
  d. Else:       TODO!
Then, run that script with the following syntax:
  <script> <sdcardlocation>
Where:
 <sdcardlocation> is the path to the sdcard on whom you want to measure the
write/read BW. For eg: /mnt/sdcard.
